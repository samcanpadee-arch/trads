      Smart Tools, Smart Chat, and Smart Assistant. By using the Service, you agree to these Terms and our
      <a class="link" href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>. If you’re using Tradie Assistant on behalf of a business, you confirm you have authority to bind the business.

      including any team members if you invite them.
    </p>

      <li>Don’t upload unlawful content or content you don’t have the right to use.</li>
      <li>No attempts to attack, disrupt, scrape, or reverse engineer the Service.</li>
      <li>Follow applicable laws, industry standards, and safety codes when using outputs.</li>
      <li>Don’t resell, sublicense, or misrepresent our Service without permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6) AI outputs &amp; professional responsibility</h2>
    <p><strong>AI Disclaimer.</strong> Tradie Assistant uses artificial intelligence to generate content and provide information. Outputs can be incorrect or incomplete.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Outputs are for informational purposes and productivity support — not a substitute for professional advice (including legal, financial, compliance, medical, or psychological).</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee that Tradie Assistant will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that AI outputs will always be accurate.</li>
      <li>You must verify outputs before relying on them in real-world situations and remain responsible for compliance with applicable codes and standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Smart Assistant — Documents &amp; vector store</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ownership:</strong> you retain ownership of your Documents.</li>
      <li><strong>Limited licence to us:</strong> you grant us a licence to host, index, process, transform, and display excerpts from your Documents within your account to provide Smart Assistant (and to allow your team to use them, if teams are enabled).</li>
      <li><strong>Processing &amp; retrieval:</strong> to find relevant passages quickly, Documents may be indexed in a vector store (retrieval index). Where possible, answers may include citations to page numbers/filenames.</li>
      <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> removing a Document from your library removes our references; we also request deletion from the vector store. Note that file deletion and index lifecycle are separate processes, and some indexes may have inactivity-based expiry.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> we don’t make your private Documents public or sell them. You confirm you have rights to upload them.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>8) Third-party services</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>OpenAI APIs:</strong> we send prompts and (where you choose) relevant snippets to OpenAI to generate outputs. OpenAI states API/business data isn’t used to train models by default; API logs are typically retained about 30 days for abuse/safety before removal (unless legally required to retain longer).</li>
      <li><strong>Supabase:</strong> authentication and managed Postgres store account and app data.</li>
      <li><strong>Stripe:</strong> payments and subscription management.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9) Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our handling of personal information is described in the <a class="link" href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>, which forms part of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>10) Service changes, availability &amp; betas</h2>
    <p>
      We may add, change, or discontinue features. From time to time we may offer beta/experimental features that may be unstable or withdrawn.
      The Service may be unavailable during maintenance or incidents.
    </p>

    <h2>11) Intellectual property &amp; feedback</h2>
    <p>
      We own all rights in the Service and our brand. You own your content and Documents.
      If you give us feedback or suggestions, you grant us a royalty-free licence to use them to improve the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>12) Warranties &amp; disclaimers; Australian Consumer Law</h2>
    <p>
      Except for guarantees that can’t be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law, the Service is provided “as is”.
      We don’t warrant that outputs will meet your requirements or be error-free. Nothing in these Terms limits your non-excludable consumer rights.
    </p>

    <h2>13) Limitation of liability</h2>
    <p><strong>To the fullest extent permitted by law:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>We are not liable for any damages resulting from the use or inability to use Tradie Assistant.</li>
      <li>We do not guarantee that Tradie Assistant will be error-free, uninterrupted, or that AI outputs will always be accurate.</li>
      <li>Your sole remedy for dissatisfaction with the Service is to stop using the Service.</li>
      <li><strong>Liability cap:</strong> for paid users, our total liability is capped at the fees you paid to us for the Service in the 12 months before the claim arose; for free-tier users, AUD&nbsp;100.</li>
      <li>No indirect, special, incidental, punitive, or consequential loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>14) Indemnity</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify and hold harmless <strong>Tradie Assistant</strong> from any claims, damages, or expenses arising from your misuse of the Service or violation of these Terms.
    </p>
    <h2>15) Suspension &amp; termination</h2>
    <p>
      You can cancel at any time from within the app. We may suspend or terminate your access if you breach these Terms, abuse the Service,
      or create risk for others. Upon termination, access stops; our post-termination data handling is described in the Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>16) Governing law &amp; disputes</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of Victoria, Australia. The courts of Victoria have exclusive jurisdiction over disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>17) Changes to these Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We’ll post the latest version here with the effective date above.</p>
