<p class="lead">Smart Tools help you quote faster without giving away your margin.</p>

<p>
  We asked our highest-performing crews what changed after they ditched spreadsheets. The answer: structure. Smart Tools walk
  you through scope, inclusions, and upsells so every quote feels premium even when you’re pricing in the ute.
</p>

<h3>Use inputs that mirror site checklists</h3>
<p>
  Start with a repeatable intake—materials, labour hours, travel, and compliance costs. Because Smart Tools remember your
  defaults, you only tweak the sections that changed on this job. Less typing equals fewer mistakes.
</p>

<h3>Layer optional extras</h3>
<p>
  Add upsells as toggles. The PDF and email exports highlight those add-ons so customers can approve variations faster and
  you keep scope creep under control.
</p>

<h3>Sync with Smart Chat</h3>
<p>
  Once the quote is out the door, drop the summary into Smart Chat to send a personalised follow-up. Mentioning the exact
  inclusions you priced keeps conversations tight and closes more work without extra admin.
</p>

<p>
  Bonus tip: log accepted quotes back into the app so billing, reminders, and Smart Assistant all share the same source of
  truth.
