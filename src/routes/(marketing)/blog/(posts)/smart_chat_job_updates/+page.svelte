<p class="lead">Smart Chat turns rough site notes into on-brand updates clients actually read.</p>

<p>
  Every afternoon we see the same scramble: photos, voice notes, and measurements pile up while clients wait for a quick
  progress update. Smart Chat ships with templates that convert that chaos into a tidy SMS or email that keeps clients calm
  and confident. Here’s how we coach teams to use it.
</p>

<h3>Start with the checklist</h3>
<p>
  Before you prompt the assistant, gather three pieces of context: work completed, any blockers, and the next time you’ll be
  on site. Drop them straight into Smart Chat along with attachments or photos. The model recognises hazards, compliance
  items, and even missing PPE, so you get a fact-checked summary automatically.
</p>

<h3>Use reusable prompts</h3>
<p>
  Save prompts like “Write a same-day client update with risks, site status, and tomorrow’s plan.” Our crews keep versions for
  SMS, WhatsApp, and email. Because the prompts reference your company name and tone from Settings, the replies stay
  consistent—no matter who was on the tools.
</p>

<h3>Attach proof without leaving the chat</h3>
<p>
  Smart Chat stores the files you upload alongside the conversation. When clients query a variation weeks later you have the
  original wording, timestamp, and evidence ready to go. That simple paper trail cuts admin disputes in half for most teams.
</p>

<p>
  Next step: pair Smart Chat with the Smart Tools proposal builder so the same site notes roll straight into quotes and
  invoices. Less copy/paste, more time on the job.
